Even though the coherence value test suggested 6 was the best number of topics, the distributions changed so much between 6, 10, and 12, that none of them seemed superior to the others. The text could use cleaning to improve this. Otherwise, I wonder if the topics were organizing differently than what I was expecting, like category, or product. Perhaps the organization was on something else, like positivity, or whether family was mentioned versus purely on a product."
